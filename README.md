# documentJoiner
Taking text documents, removing unwanted strings and then joining them all into one text file using python.

======================

This code was written as a learning project on 24 September 2021. 

We needed to take a lot of text documents that have information about share changes and put it all into one file.

I broke this project into bits:

1 - Getting filenames from folder.

2 - Going through filenames and re-writing that information to another text document.

3 - Adding the date of the file to the text document.

4 - Taking the text document with all the information in it and going through and deleting specific strings we do not need.

5 - Write that information to another text document.
