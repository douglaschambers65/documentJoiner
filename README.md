## Purpose

To take information contained in multiple standard flat text files and combine them into a single file with some processing.

## Background

We needed to take a lot of text documents that have information about share changes and put it all into one file.

I broke this project into bits:

1 - Getting filenames from folder.<br />
2 - Going through filenames and re-writing that information to another text document.<br />
3 - Adding the date of the file to the text document.<br />
4 - Taking the text document with all the information in it and going through and deleting specific strings we do not need.<br />
5 - Write that information to another text document
